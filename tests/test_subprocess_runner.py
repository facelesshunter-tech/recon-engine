"""Regression test for a real bug found while testing web_crawl.py against
a slow-responding target: subprocess.TimeoutExpired.stdout/.stderr are
always raw bytes in Python, even when text=True was passed to
subprocess.run() -- unlike the normal successful-completion path, which
decodes properly. The original timeout handler returned those bytes
objects as-is, so every caller downstream that called .splitlines() on a
timed-out result got a list of bytes objects instead of str, which then
printed/compared as `b'...'`-repr strings anywhere they flowed into
string-based logic (dedupe_strings, report rendering, etc.) -- silent
and easy to miss as a bug, since it only shows up when a tool times out
with partial output already captured, not on clean success or a
no-output failure.
