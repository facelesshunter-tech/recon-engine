"""Regression test for a real bug found during manual verification:
gowitness_scan's JSONL parser looked for the screenshot path under
"filename" or "screenshot" keys, but gowitness v3 actually writes it
under "file_name" (and leaves "screenshot" as an empty string). Fixed by
reading "file_name" and joining it onto the screenshot directory path.
This test uses a real JSONL line captured from an actual gowitness run
against https://one.one.one.one during verification, trimmed of fields
screenshotting.py doesn't use.
