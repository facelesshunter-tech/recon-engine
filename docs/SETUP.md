# Setup

## 1. Python environment

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## 2. External tool binaries

recon-engine orchestrates these rather than reimplementing them (see
`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` for why). Install whichever ones you want — every
module degrades gracefully with a clear warning if its tool is missing,
so you don't need all of them to get started.

| Tool | Install | Used by |

Run `recon-engine config-check` any time to see exactly which of these
are currently detected on `PATH`.

## 3. API keys

Copy `config/config.example.yaml` to `config/config.yaml` and fill in
whatever you have. Priority order (matches TBHM's own KB §12.4
recommendation):

1. **Chaos** — free, instant signup: https://chaos.projectdiscovery.io
2. **GitHub tokens** — free, instant: https://github.com/settings/tokens
   (classic tokens, no special scopes needed for code search). Get
   **several** — recon-engine round-robins across all configured tokens.
3. **Shodan** — freemium: https://account.shodan.io/register
4. **Free/cheap**: FacebookCT (requires creating a Facebook Developer
   app — see the deck's own walkthrough, reproduced in
   `config/config.example.yaml`'s comments), c99/RiskIQ, dnsdumpster
5. **Paid/limited**: whoxy, whoisxmlapi, host.io, SecurityTrails,
   Crunchbase (enterprise sales contact, not self-serve), sec-api.io
   (free tier available), greyhatwarfare
6. **Censys** (search.censys.io -- Personal Access Token, format
   `API_ID:SECRET`) and **urlscan.io** (free tier) -- both optional,
   feed `internet_intel.py` alongside Uncover (which itself needs no
   dedicated key beyond whatever Shodan/Censys/etc. keys you already
   have configured for the underlying engines it queries)

## 4. Not wired up (or not automated) — and why (read this before filing an issue)

- **Tracxn, Pitchbook, OCCRP Aleph**: browse-only / enterprise-gated web
  tools with no public API suited to this use case.
  `acquisitions.py: manual_research_checklist()` gives you direct search
  URLs instead.
- **Google Alerts**: no public API for programmatically creating an
  alert. Set one up by hand for `"<company> acquisition"` as the deck
  itself demonstrates.
- **Mass Google/Bing dorking**: search engines actively block scripted
  querying at volume. `subdomain_passive.py: google_exclusion_dork()`
  generates the query string for you to paste into a browser, same as
  the deck's own manual workflow.
- **DuckDuckGo Tracker Radar / Cloudflare Radar**: named in the deck's
  final appendix with no elaboration beyond the title. Both have real
  public APIs/datasets; not wired up because there's no concrete
  technique described to implement against — see
  `TBHM-DAY-ONE-KNOWLEDGE-BASE.md` §22.4 for exactly what the source
  said (very little).
- **check_mdi.py**: the deck itself marks this deprecated/broken
  (Microsoft changed `GetFederationInformation`'s behavior). Not
  reimplemented on purpose — see `msft_tenant.py` for the working
  replacement approach.
- **EyeWitness**: kept alongside `gowitness` specifically for its
  default-credential-checker, which TBHM calls out as still unmatched
  elsewhere. Not part of the automated `scan --screenshots` pipeline by
  design (see `screenshotting.py`'s module docstring) -- call
  `screenshotting.eyewitness()` directly against a short list of your
  top-scored hosts after a normal scan, not against everything.

  Its official installer (`setup/setup.sh`) hard-requires root and
  refuses to run otherwise -- but in practice almost everything it wants
  (Chromium, chromedriver, Xvfb, jq, cmake) is commonly already present
  on a system that's done any security-tool work, leaving only a couple
  of pure-Python packages. The no-sudo path that actually worked:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/RedSiege/EyeWitness.git ~/tools/EyeWitness
  # Check what's actually missing before assuming you need the root-only installer:
  which chromium chromedriver jq cmake Xvfb
  python3 -c "import selenium, netaddr, psutil"
  # Typically only this is missing:
  pip3 install --user pyvirtualdisplay
  pip3 install --user -r ~/tools/EyeWitness/setup/requirements.txt
  # Verify:
  python3 ~/tools/EyeWitness/Python/EyeWitness.py --web --single https://example.com -d /tmp/ew-test --no-prompt
  ```

  If your system genuinely lacks Chromium/chromedriver/Xvfb, you *will*
  need `sudo apt-get install chromium chromium-driver xvfb jq cmake` (or
  your distro's equivalents) for those specific packages -- there's no
  way around installing a browser without root. The point above is just
  that the official script assumes you need the *entire* list via root,
  when usually you don't.

  Point `tools.eyewitness` at a wrapper script (or the real binary) once
  installed; a one-line shim like
  `exec python3 "$HOME/tools/EyeWitness/Python/EyeWitness.py" "$@"`
  saved as `~/.local/bin/eyewitness` (executable) is the simplest way to
  get it discovered on `PATH` alongside everything else.

## 5. First run

```bash
recon-engine config-check
recon-engine scan example.com
recon-engine scan example.com --github --screenshots --favicon --favicon-db ./favfreak-hashes.json
recon-engine scan example.com --bruteforce --permutation --wordlist words.txt --resolvers resolvers.txt
recon-engine changes example.com --since-hours 168
recon-engine sources --target example.com
```

Only scan targets you are authorized to test.

## 6. A senior-methodology deep-dive run, step by step

Everything in step 5 covers the cheap, passive-by-default stages
(`--subfinder`/`--amass`/`--crtsh`/`--assetfinder`, DNS validation, live
validation, TLS probing -- all on by default). The deep-dive stages below
are deliberately opt-in, because they're either active/intrusive, slow,
or both -- turn them on one at a time, in roughly this order, the same
way a senior hunter would stage their own manual workflow:

```bash
# 1. Widen passive discovery as far as it goes (GitHub + GitDorker +
#    cloud_enum + Uncover), still zero traffic to the target itself:
recon-engine scan example.com --github --gitdorker --gitdorker-keyword example \
  --cloud-enum --cloud-enum-keyword example --uncover --uncover-query 'hostname:"example.com"'

# 2. Confirm you actually want to generate live traffic, then fingerprint
#    what's really there (WAF + screenshots + favicon):
recon-engine scan example.com --waf-detect --screenshots --favicon --favicon-db ./favfreak-hashes.json

# 3. Crawl what's live and mine what used to be live (feeds JS analysis):
recon-engine scan example.com --web-crawl --js-analysis

# 4. Now that you have real endpoints (from step 3), look for hidden
#    parameters and undocumented API routes on the ones worth your time:
recon-engine scan example.com --parameter-discovery --api-discovery

# 5. Only once scoring has flagged a host against the edge-device CVE
#    watchlist, confirm it with a SCOPED nuclei run (never general
#    scanning) and sharpen the score with live EPSS/KEV data:
recon-engine scan example.com --vuln-verify --cve-intel
```

Every run produces three separate, "well arranged and neat" output
files per target (see the README's "What a scan produces" section) --
the ranked worklist, the architecture/tech-detection map, and (if any
deep-dive stage was enabled) the raw auxiliary findings file. Nothing
from the deep-dive stages gets silently merged into the ranked
worklist; it's kept in its own file precisely so you can tell "what
should I look at first" apart from "what did every tool actually find."
