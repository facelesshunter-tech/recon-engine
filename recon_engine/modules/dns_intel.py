"""DNS intelligence / bulk resolution enrichment (dnsx).

This sits between "raw candidate subdomain list" (from subdomain_passive +
subdomain_bruteforce + permutation, after dedupe) and "live host probing"
(httpx) in the senior-methodology pipeline ordering: before spending time
screenshotting/crawling/fuzzing a host, confirm it actually resolves, and
pull its record data (A/AAAA/CNAME/MX/TXT/NS) in bulk, in one pass, rather
than relying on httpx's liveness check alone -- httpx tells you "is there
a web server here," dnsx tells you "does this name even exist, and what
does it point to," which is the cheaper, earlier-stage question to ask
first. It also filters out wildcard-DNS false positives (a single
`*.example.com` wildcard record would otherwise make every bruteforce/
permutation guess look like it "resolved"), which is exactly the kind of
noise puredns's own wildcard-detection threading handles for bruteforce
but doesn't retroactively clean up candidates that arrived from *other*
sources (passive scraping, GitHub, AI guesses).
