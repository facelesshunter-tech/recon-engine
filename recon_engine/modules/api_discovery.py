"""API route/endpoint brute-forcing (Kiterunner).

Kiterunner's `-A` flag fetches a named wordlist live from Assetnote's
hosted service (`wordlist.assetnote.io`) -- its documented default. That
host turned out to be DNS-unreachable from this project's own dev
sandbox (confirmed directly), which took the whole stage offline with it
every time. Rather than hard-depend on that one host being reachable,
this module defaults to building and using a small LOCAL `.kite`
wordlist instead, compiled once from SecLists' own API-route lists via
`kr kb convert` (confirmed directly: `-w` requires the compiled `.kite`
protobuf format, but `kr kb convert <txt> <kite>` happily builds one from
any plain text wordlist -- no dependency on Assetnote's specific hosted
JSON schema at all). Assetnote's bigger, continuously-updated hosted list
remains available as an explicit opt-in (`use_assetnote_hosted=True`) for
environments with normal internet access to it.

IMPORTANT automation-safety finding, verified directly: without
`--kitebuilder-full-scan`, kr's default two-phase scan behavior asks an
interactive `[y/n]` terminal prompt ("Continue Scanning with full
wordlist?") when its first phase finds nothing -- which would hang a
subprocess call indefinitely with no TTY to answer it. This module
always passes `--kitebuilder-full-scan` for exactly that reason.

The per-route HIT record shape (method/url/status_code/content_length)
is now confirmed against a real positive match, scanned with the local
wordlist against a live target -- no longer just an inference from
Kiterunner's documented convention.
