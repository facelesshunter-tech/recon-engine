"""Screenshotting for recon triage (TBHM KB §17).

The deck names several tools and explicitly says "this whole section is
very much user preference" -- no single canonical tool. This module
supports all three:

- `go_stare` -- fast, lightweight, no browser install needed.
- `gowitness_scan` -- the default/recommended engine. Native binary (v3
  no longer requires Docker), returns structured per-host data (title,
  status, screenshot path) that the pipeline folds directly into the
  final report.
- `eyewitness` -- kept specifically for its default-credential-checker,
  the one capability the deck calls out as still unmatched elsewhere,
  despite EyeWitness being the oldest tool in this list. Its official
  installer insists on `sudo apt-get`, which this project won't run
  non-interactively -- but in practice every system dependency it wants
  (Chromium, chromedriver, Xvfb, jq, cmake) is commonly already present,
  leaving only a couple of pure-Python pip packages to install by hand.
  See docs/SETUP.md for the exact no-sudo install path that was actually
  used.

Not wired into the automated `scan --screenshots` pipeline by design --
unlike go-stare/gowitness, EyeWitness is meaningfully slower and its real
value (default-cred checking) is best spent deliberately, against your
top-scored hosts from `scoring/prioritize.py` after a normal scan, not
blanket-run against every discovered host. Call `eyewitness()` directly
for that targeted second pass.
