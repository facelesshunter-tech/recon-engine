"""Web crawling and historical URL mining (Katana, GAU).

The gap flagged earliest and most repeatedly across this whole project:
recon-engine could tell you a host was alive, but never actually crawled
*into* it to find real endpoints. Two complementary techniques:

- `katana_crawl` -- active, JS-aware crawling of a *live* host right now
  (`-jc` parses endpoints out of JS files it encounters, not just HTML
  links) -- only run this against hosts live_validation.py already
  confirmed are up, same "don't waste a stage on dead hosts" discipline
  dns_intel.py's filtering exists for.
- `gau_historical` -- passive, no live traffic to the target at all:
  pulls every URL ever seen for a domain across Wayback Machine,
  CommonCrawl, OTX, and urlscan.io's own archives. Finds old/forgotten
  endpoints that current crawling never would, because they're not
  linked from the live site anymore.

Both feed the same downstream stages: js_analysis.py (secrets/endpoints
inside the JS files these two surface) and parameter_discovery.py
(hidden params on the endpoints these two surface).
