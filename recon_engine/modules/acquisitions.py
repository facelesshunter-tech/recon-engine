"""Acquisition / business-intel discovery (TBHM KB §9).

New apex domains frequently enter scope through corporate acquisitions
(Twitch's own Justin.tv -> Twitch Interactive history, used repeatedly as
the deck's running example, and the Tesla/SolarCity example). TBHM names
four sources: Crunchbase, Tracxn, Pitchbook, OCCRP Aleph.

Honest implementation note: Crunchbase's API requires a paid enterprise
agreement and a signed data license (not a simple API-key sign-up);
Tracxn, Pitchbook, and OCCRP Aleph are browse-only web tools with no
public API suitable for this use case at all. This module implements
Crunchbase as a best-effort wrapper that activates only if you have
enterprise API access configured, and documents the other three as
manual-research steps rather than pretending they can be automated --
consistent with what was flagged up front as not fully automatable.
