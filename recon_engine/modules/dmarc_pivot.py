"""DMARC analysis / shared-DMARC-record pivoting (TBHM KB §8).

Companies frequently centralize DMARC reporting under one third-party
identifier (e.g. dmarcian's `rua=mailto:n2ju30bc@ag.dmarcian.com` in the
Tesla example) across every domain/subdomain they own. Finding that shared
identifier lets you pivot to every other domain using it.

Two distinct capabilities, both from the deck:

1. `get_dmarc_record` / `shared_identifier_across_known_subdomains`:
   pure DNS, no API key needed -- this is the dmarc-subdomains
   (Tedixx) tool's actual technique applied to a list of subdomains you
   already have (from subdomain_passive/subdomain_bruteforce), grouping
   them by identical DMARC reporting identifier.

2. `reverse_search_by_identifier`: finding *new, previously-unknown*
   domains across the internet sharing that identifier requires a
   DNS/TXT-record-reverse-search service (dmarc.live and dmarcly.com are
   consumer web tools with no clean bulk API for this; SecurityTrails'
   DNS search API is used here as the closest real equivalent, since it
   supports structured DNS-record search). Marked best-effort: the exact
   request shape for this specific use case should be verified against
   SecurityTrails' current docs before relying on it in production, since
   this was implemented from documented API patterns rather than a live
   test against a paid account.
