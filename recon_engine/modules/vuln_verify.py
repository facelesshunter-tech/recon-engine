"""Scoped vulnerability verification (Nuclei) -- for ONE job only:
confirming the edge-device CVEs scoring/prioritize.py already flags by
tech-stack guess, not general-purpose vulnerability scanning.

This is the one deliberate exception carved out of an otherwise firm
"vulnerability scanning doesn't belong in a recon tool" position (see the
project's own tool-category assessment: recon-engine is a crawler/
discovery tool, not a scanner). The distinction that makes this
acceptable: `verify_watchlist()` only ever runs the EXACT nuclei template
IDs matching scoring.prioritize.EDGE_DEVICE_CVE_WATCHLIST's CVE list --
never a tag-based, severity-based, or default full-template-library scan.
It answers "is the thing we already suspect actually true," not "what
else might be wrong here."

Nuclei's JSONL schema (template-id/info/matched-at/host) is treated as
reliably documented and stable -- it's the same ProjectDiscovery JSONL
convention recon-engine already parses from httpx -- unlike a couple of
this session's newer/rarer integrations (Kiterunner) where the exact
schema genuinely wasn't independently confirmable here.
